# Visual Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for Mobile Robot Control

This project, completed under an Undergraduate Research Scholarship, aims to develop a simplistic HMI for commanding mobile robots. It does so through a "point and click" interface. The user suggests a location by pointing to a visible location on the robot's camera feed. It then determines if that point is navigable and approaches it.

See [the poster](2022_URS_Visual_HMI_Poster.pdf) for more information.
